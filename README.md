# afterfx-scripting-snippets
Miscellaneous scripts I've written for automating processes After Effects. Released versions available along with their installation instructions at https://payhip.com/ahrevolvers.

## Scripts
 - VegasMarkersToAE: Converts Vegas marker export files to After Effects markers in the current comp.
 - PrPresetsToAE: Converts Premiere presets to After Effects presets.
 - VegasPresetsToAE: Converts Vegas .xml preset files to After Effects presets. Supports some Sapphire plugin fx.
 - cutsToCompMarkers: Converts in and out points on all layers in the current comp to comp markers
 - deNumberer: Removes the layer name numbers you get from making duplicate layers.
 - frameBlender: Toggles frame blending or pixel motion on layers in the current comp. Can also look in precomps recursively.
 - hotswap: Given 1 selected layer, selects the layer below it and moves that layer above it.
 - keyframeCollapser: Collapses any number of keyframes to be 1 frame apart from one another starting at the first keyframe in the property.
 - precomper: Precomps all selected layers.
 - propCopy: Copies the selected (effect properties/effects) to other layers in (the current comp/the current comp and any below it/a specific comp/all comps) with the same effect(s).
 - setUpStreams: Imports, organizes, and sets up multi-pass video game recording footage. Fair warning, it's a bit buggy.
